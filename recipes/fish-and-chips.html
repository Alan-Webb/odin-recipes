    <h1>Crispy Beer Batter Fish & Chips</h1>

    <img src="../images/fish-and-chips.jpg" alt="Crispy Beer Battered Fish & Chips" width="310" height="310">

    <h2 class="green">Description</h2>
    <p>Serve this beer-battered fish over a bed of salt and vinegar chips with tartar sauce and lemon. Virtually every beer-battered fish recipe looks crispy coming out of the fryer, and some even stay crispy for a few minutes, but then the inevitable sogginess sets in. With this simple formula and a few easy tricks, your last bite will be as crisp as your first. The keys are keeping the batter really cold and patting the fish completely dry.</p>

    <h2 class="green">Ingredients</h2>
    <h3 id="h3">Batter:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup self-raising flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons rice flour</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 cup lager-style beer, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="h3">Fish:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 (6 ounce) cod fillets, fully thawed if frozen</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons rice flour, or as needed</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="green">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Start with the batter: Whisk self-rising flour, and baking powder together in a bowl. Freeze until ready to use.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Make the fish: Pat cod as dry as possible, then cut lengthwise into eight 1-inch-thick strips. Place rice flour on a plate and season with salt. Dust cod lightly with the rice flour mixture and shake off any excess. Cover a plate with crinkled foil to make a quick drying rack; place cod on top.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <br>
      <li>Finish the batter: Remove flour mixture from the freezer. Pour in beer and whisk until batter is the consistency of a thick pancake batter, adding more beer as needed.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Dip floured cod into the batter to coat; lift out and let excess drip off.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Fry cod in batches until golden brown, dunking occasionally if needed, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
